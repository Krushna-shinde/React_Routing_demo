        About Page:
        <br />I gained experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frontend
        frameworks. I have completed several projects that demonstrate my
        ability to build responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. I
        have also developed strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills,
        which enable me to identify and resolve issues quickly and efficiently.
        Moreover, I am passionate about learning and staying up-to-date with the
        latest trends and best practices in frontend development. I am
        proficient in using Git and other version control systems, and I am
        comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure timely
        delivery of high-quality products. As a quick learner and a team player,
        I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your team. I
        am eager to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and fresh perspective to this
        position and grow my career in frontend development.
